    This is the PIMS proteomics LIMS system.  Here you can see your existing projects and results, and can share these with others.
  </p>
  <p>
    To start a new project you must first contact the proteomics facility to discuss the work and get them to create a project for you.  Once created you can then add samples and see results once they start to appear.
